<h1>Trace On Map</h1>
<hr><p>The app defines a web application that performs a traceroute to a specified destination address and displays the results on a map. 

The application is built using Flask and makes use of several external libraries, including scapy, geopy, and folium. The traceroute is performed using the traceroute function from the scapy library, and the location data for each hop is retrieved using the ip-api.com API. 

The location data is then displayed on a folium map, which is saved to an HTML file and opened in the user's default web browser. 

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows best practices for web application development in Python. However, there may be some room for improvement in terms of error handling and security, such as validating user input and handling exceptions that may be raised during the traceroute or location data retrieval processes.</p><h2>Technologies Used</h2>
